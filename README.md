# Web app class

Presentation is in /presentation/presentation.html.

App is in /app. Use 1.8.7 or fix requires - OSX is 1.8.7 by default, as is, I belive, cygwin. You'll need to install RubyGems if you're using Ruby < 1.9.

    cd /app
    rvm use 1.8.7
    gem install sinatra
    ruby site.rb

localhost:4567 to see the app.
