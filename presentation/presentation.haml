  %h1 Web app
%section
  %h2 What does a web app do
  %p Provides the HTML a user sees
  %p By:
  %ul
    %li identifying user
    %li reloading their data
    %li generating HTML (or other formats)

%section
  %h2 Server
  %p Does what you'd think: 'serves up' something to the browser
  %p HTML

%section
  %h2 HTML
  %p Plain text file sent to client.
  %p May require more requests for non-inlined resources
  %ul
    %li images
    %li videos
    %li sounds
    %li CSS, Javascript
%section
  %h2 URLs
  %table
    %tr
      %td http://
      %td www
      %td .google
      %td .com
      %td /search.html
      %td ?q=foo
    %tr
      %td.colour1 protocol
      %td.colour2 subdomain
      %td.colour3 domain
      %td.colour4 tld
      %td.colour5 path
      %td.colour6 query string
%section
  %h2 Identifying a server
  %p Name is looked up via the Domain Name System, giving an IP of a server.
  %p Server takes the request, reads the URL and any data POSTed, and replies.
  %p Request and respose are made up of HTTP headers, and optionally some data.
%section
  %h2 Simplified story
  %p
    You want google, you ask for
    %code http://www.google.co.uk/404.html
  %p
    DNS tells the browser to connect to
    = succeed "." do
      %code 173.194.34.128

%section
  %p You send
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
            GET / HTTP/1.1
            Host: www.google.co.uk

%section
  %p You get
  %pre
    %code
      :escaped
        <html lang=en>
        <meta charset=utf-8>
        <meta name=viewport content="initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, width=device-width">
        <title>Error 404 (Not Found)!!1</title>
        <style>/* style */</style>
        <a href=//www.google.com/><img src=//www.google.com/images/errors/logo_sm.gif alt=Google></a>
        <p><b>404.</b> <ins>That’s an error.</ins>
        <p>The requested URL <code>/404.html</code> was not found on this server.  <ins>That’s all we know.</ins>

%section
  %h2 Then
  %p Your browser sees
  %pre
    %code
      :escaped
        <img src=//www.google.com/images/errors/logo_sm.gif alt=Google></a>
  %p so it sends
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        GET /images/errors/logo_sm.gif HTTP/1.1
        Host: www.google.com
  %p and receives the image

%section
  %h2 Where does the web app come in? 
  %p Receives request from browser via server
  %p Provides a response which the server serves up to the client.

%section
  %h2 How?
  %h3 Request
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        GET /answer.html HTTP/1.1
        Host: http://meaningoflife.com
  %p web app code
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        if path == "/answer.html"
          respond "&lt;h1>42, obviously&lt;/h1>"
        end

%section
  %p
    server gives the app code the
    %code path
    \- "/answer.html" as a variable.
  %p
    The app code reads the variables, and fires a
    %code respond
    function that passes a response to the server. 
       
%section
  %p Response is then served up as:
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 
        Content-Length: 42
    
        &lt;h1>42 is quite obviously the answer.&lt;/h1>

%section
  %h2 Types of request

  %p Two main types:
  %ul
    %li
      %code GET&nbsp;
      retrive something, search for something
    %li
      %code POST&nbsp;
      provide something to server

%section
  %h2 How to create from HTML
  %p
    %code GET 
    requests are triggered simply by requesting a URL via a link
  %p
    %code POST
    requests are triggered via form with an
    %code method=post
    attribute. They send data.

%section
  %h2 So
  %p Our task: take HTTP data from client, and respond with HTML.
  %p We're going to do that using Ruby.
  %p.minor * static files (images, CSS, JS, videos) are normally served by a server.

%section
  %h2 Ruby
  %p
    Ruby is a nice language made by
    %a{href:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto"} Matz
  %p "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer ... to enjoy programming, and to be happy"
  %p 
    It has a 
    %a{href:"http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide"} comic book
    by 
    %a{href:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff"} why the lucky stiff
  %img{src:'img/whys.gif',style:"display:block;margin:0 auto;"}

%section
  %h2 Ruby looks like
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        description = "ruby is fun"
        backwards = description.reverse
    
        # this is a comment, the computer can't see us here (haha, dumb computer)
        # so we can leave ourselves notes about what's going to happen
        # like that the next line will print "nuf si ybur" to the screen
        puts backwards

%section
  %h2 Fundamentals of programming
  %p Store things in variables.
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        programming = "fun"
  %p You can copy, and overwrite them
  %pre
    :preserve
      programming_web_applications = programming
      programming = "super-fun"

%section
  %h2 Logic
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        if (Monday..Thursday).include?(today)
          puts "boo"
        else
          puts "yay!"
        end
  %pre
    :preserve
      if current_user == nil
        puts "&lt;h1>logged out&lt;/h1>"
      end

%section
  %h2 Functions
  %p Functions are like black boxes you can reuse. You put things in & get things out.
  %pre
    :preserve
      def add(a,b)
        return a + b
      end

      add(5,10)  # 15
      add(-5,10) # 5

%section
  %h2 Using functions
  %p You pass in variables and values as arguments
  %pre
    :preserve
      def circumference(r)
        Math.PI * 2 * r
      end
  
      radius = 5
      circum = circumference(radius)
      puts "the circle's circumference is \#{circum}"

%section
  %h2 Data
  %p Inside our programs we keep data in data structures.
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        cats = ["tabby","persian","calico"]
        hello = {
          "fr" => "bonjour",
          "en" => "hello",
          "th" => "สวัสดี"
        }

%section
  %h2
    Introducing: 
    %code Array, 
    %code Hash
  %p
    We just met the two you'll be using in Ruby -
    %code Array
    and
    = succeed "." do
      %code Hash
  %p
    %code Array
    is just a list of things with an order. Days of the week, jobs in a queue etc.
  %p
    %code Hash
    map a key to a value, like a dictionary (you can also call them dictionaries).

%section
  %h2 Looking up
  %p
    You lookup items inside the structures in the same way -
    = succeed "," do
      %code []
    like a little pidgeon hole.
  %p
    %code> Arrays&nbsp;
    are only looked up by position:
    %code cats[1]
    is... "tabby" (array indexes (position) start from 0).
  %p
    %code> Hashes&nbsp;
    are looked up by key:
    %code hello["fr"]
    is "bonjour".

%section
  %h2 Databases
  %p We don't have a variable for every bit of data in our system.
  %p
    FB has 500 million users - they don't have a variable
    = succeed "." do
      %code user5000000000
  %p We store data in a database program. We send data to the database, and we can retrieve it later.

%section
  %h2 Mongo
  %p We'll be using a very simple database called Mongo.
  %p Actually a fake version so you don't need to install.
  %p Looks the same in the code so you'll be able to use Mongo yourself later!

%section
  %h2 Database example
  %p Bob's browser sends us
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        GET /?name=bob HTTP/1.1
  %p in our program, we look up
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        db = FakeMongo::Connection.new
        users = db["users"]
    
        user = users.find({ "_id" => params["name"] })
        respond("&lt;h1&gt;Hello \#{user["name"]}, you like \#{user["interests"]}&lt;/h1&gt;")

%section
  %h2 Getting data in
  %p Let's have a sneak preview of the web app we'll be creating:
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        user = users.insert("_id" => params["name"], "name" => params["name"])
  %p
    Pretty simple hey? We're using the name as an id, and also storing it as
    %code name
    for consistency.

%section
  %h2 Updating
  %p ...is also very simple:
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        users.update(
          {"_id" => params["name"]},
          {"visits" => user["visits"] + 1}
        )

%section
  %h2 Database summary
  %p We're using a fake version of a database called Mongo. It's free to download
  %p We use databases to store data permantently, so we can retrieve it in our programs.
  %p
    We
    %code insert
    data into the database,
    %code find
    it, and we can also
    %code update
    it.

%section
  %h2 Our first web application
  %p Well done so far...

%section
  %h2 Meet Sinatra
  %p Sinatra is an open-source program for writing web applications. It looks like this
  %pre
    :preserve
      get "/" do
        return "&lt;h1>You just asked for the root path!&lt;/h1>"
      end
%section
  %pre
    :preserve
      get "/" do
        return "&lt;h1>You just asked for the root path!&lt;/h1>"
      end
  %p
    We've called a function for the HTTP verb 'get', which takes a route -
    = succeed "," do
      %code "/"
  %p
    We write what looks like a function (actually a block - later) to tell it what to do in response.
  %p If we return HTML, it is sent to the client.


%section
  %h2 Responses
  %p Return HTML, browser will receive it
  %p
    %code redirect("/")&nbsp;
    redirects to the root path

%section
  %h2 Sessions
  %p Store client state between request
  %p Client state - so logged in vs logged out, not user data
  %p e.g: things that just happened in client - temporary messages

%section
  %h2 Using sessions
  %pre
    :preserve
      def login user
        session["user"] = user
      end
  %p Stores a reference to our logged in user's name
  %pre
    :preserve
      def current_user
        users.find({"_id" => session["user.name"]})
      end

%section
  %h2 Temporary messages
  %pre
    :preserve
      def message(msg)
        session["message"] = msg
      end
      def woops(msg)
        session["woops"] = msg
      end
