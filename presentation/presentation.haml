%section
  %h2 What is a web app?
  %p An application accessible via the browser
  %p Captures, retrieves and displays user data
  %p Data can be video, text, photos etc

%section
  %h2 How does it do it?
  %p By:
  %ul
    %li interpreting request
    %li retrieving/generating data
    %li generating HTML to display (or other formats)

%section
  %h2 Works with a server
  %p Servers do what you'd think: 'serve up' something to the browser.
  %p Handles listening for connections etc, then passes the requests on to our web app.
  %p Normally handles requests for static files (images, CSS, JS, videos) without our web app.

%section
  %h2 HTML
  %p Plain text file sent to client.
  %p May trigger more requests for non-inlined resources
  %ul
    %li images
    %li videos
    %li sounds
    %li CSS, Javascript

%section
  %h2 URLs
  %table
    %tr
      %td http://
      %td www
      %td .google
      %td .com
      %td /search.html
      %td ?q=foo
    %tr
      %td.colour1 protocol
      %td.colour2 subdomain
      %td.colour3 domain
      %td.colour4 tld
      %td.colour5 path
      %td.colour6 query string

%section
  %h2 Request/response
  %p
    You want google, you ask for
    %code http://www.guardian.co.uk/sports
  %p You send
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
            GET /sports HTTP/1.1
            Host: www.guardian.co.uk/

%section
  %p You get
  %pre
    %code
      :escaped
        <html lang=en>
        <meta charset=utf-8>
        <title>Sport news, comment and results | Sport | The Guardian </title>
        ...

%section
  %h2 Where does the web app come in? 
  %p Handed the HTTP request from browser by server.
  %p Provides a response which the server serves up to the client.

%section
  %h2 Example
  %h3 Request
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        GET /answer.html HTTP/1.1
        Host: http://meaningoflife.com
  %p web app code
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        if path == "/answer.html"
          respond "&lt;h1>42, obviously&lt;/h1>"
        end

%section
  %p
    server gives the app code the
    %code path
    \- "/answer.html" as a variable.
  %p
    The app code reads the variables, and fires a
    %code respond
    function that passes a response to the server. 
       
%section
  %p Response is then served up as:
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 
        Content-Length: 42
    
        &lt;h1>42 is quite obviously the answer.&lt;/h1>

%section
  %h2 Types of request

  %p Two main types:
  %ul
    %li
      %code GET&nbsp;
      retrieve something, search for something
    %li
      %code POST&nbsp;
      provide something to server, for changing state

%section
  %h2 How to create from HTML
  %p
    %code GET 
    requests are triggered simply by requesting a URL via a link, or via JS
  %p
    %code POST
    requests are triggered via form with an
    %code method=post
    attribute, or via JS, sending data.

%section
  %h2 Summary
  %p Web apps respond to HTTP requests.
  %p They work hand-in-hand with a server, which passes it dynamic requests.
  %p They interpret requests, gather data, and transform it into a response.

%section
  %h2 Writing a web app
  %p Our task: take HTTP data from client, and respond.
  %p We're going to do that using Ruby.
  %p You could also use Python, Javascript (node.js), PHP etc.

%section
  %h2 Ruby
  %p
    Ruby is a nice language made by
    %a{href:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto"} Matz
  %p "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer ... to enjoy programming, and to be happy"
  %p 
    It has a 
    %a{href:"http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide"} comic book
    by 
    %a{href:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff"} why the lucky stiff
  %img{src:'img/whys.gif',style:"display:block;margin:0 auto;"}

%section
  %h2 Ruby looks like
  %pre
    :preserve
      description = "ruby is fun"
      backwards = description.reverse

      # this is a comment, the computer can't see us here
      puts "printed backwards '\#{backwards}'"

  %p
    Outputs "printed backwards 'nuf si ybur'"

%section
  %h2 Fundamentals of programming
  %p Store things in variables.
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        programming = "fun"
  %p You can copy, and overwrite them
  %pre
    :preserve
      programming_web_applications = programming
      programming = "super-fun"

%section
  %h2 Logic
  %pre
    :preserve
      if current_user == nil
        puts "&lt;h1>logged out&lt;/h1>"
      end
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        get "/signup" do
          if logged_in?()
            redirect("/")
          else
            render("signup")
          end
        end

%section
  %h2 Functions
  %p Functions are like black boxes you can reuse. You put things in & get things out.
  %pre
    :preserve
      def add(a,b)
        return a + b
      end

      add(5,10)  # 15
      add(-5,10) # 5

%section
  %h2 Using functions
  %p You pass in variables and values as arguments
  %pre
    :preserve
      def circumference(r)
        Math.PI * 2 * r
      end
  
      radius = 5
      circum = circumference(radius)
      puts "the circle's circumference is \#{circum}"

%section
  %h2 Data
  %p Inside our programs we keep data in data structures.
  %pre
    %code
      :preserve
        cats = ["tabby","persian","calico"]
        hello = {
          "fr" => "bonjour",
          "en" => "hello",
          "th" => "สวัสดี"
        }

%section
  %h2
    Introducing: 
    %code Array, 
    %code Hash
  %p
    We just met the two you'll be using in Ruby -
    %code Array
    and
    = succeed "." do
      %code Hash
  %p
    %code Array
    is just a list of things with an order. Days of the week, jobs in a queue etc.
  %p
    %code Hash
    map a key to a value, like a dictionary (you can also call them dictionaries).

%section
  %h2 Looking up
  %p
    You lookup items inside the structures in the same way -
    = succeed "," do
      %code []
    looks like a pigeon hole.
  %p
    %code> Arrays&nbsp;
    are only looked up by position:
    %code cats[1]
    is... "persian" (array indexes (position) start from 0).
  %p
    %code> Hashes&nbsp;
    are looked up by key:
    %code hello["fr"]
    is "bonjour".


%section
  %h2 Our first web application
  %p Well done so far...

%section
  %h2 Meet Sinatra
  %p Sinatra is an open-source program for writing web applications. It looks like this
  %pre
    :preserve
      get "/" do
        return "&lt;h1>You asked for the root path!&lt;/h1>"
      end

%section
  %pre
    :preserve
      get "/" do
        return "&lt;h1>You asked for the root path!&lt;/h1>"
      end
  %p
    We've called a function for the HTTP verb 'get', which takes a route -
    = succeed "," do
      %code "/"
  %p
    We write what looks like a function (actually a block - later) to tell it what to do in response.
  %p If we return HTML, it is sent to the client.


%section
  %h2 Responses
  %p Return HTML, browser will receive it
  %p
    %code redirect("/")&nbsp;
    redirects to the root path

%section
  %h2 Sessions
  %p Store client state between request
  %p Client state - so logged in vs logged out, not user data
  %p e.g: things that just happened in client - temporary messages

%section
  %h2 Using sessions
  %pre
    :preserve
      def login user
        session["user_id"] = user["name"]
      end
  %p Stores a reference to our logged in user's name
  %pre
    :preserve
      def current_user
        users[ session["user_id"] ]
      end

%section
  %h2 Temporary messages
  %pre
    :preserve
      def message(msg)
        session["message"] = msg
      end
      def woops(msg)
        session["woops"] = msg
      end
  %p
    We call these functions to set a message to be displayed next request.

%section
  %h2 Let's have a look at the app
  %p Simplest possible app - signup, login, logout.
  %p Display list of users.
  %p Demonstrates routing, redirects, sessions and database.

%section
  %h2 Deciding on routes
  %p GET for resources
  %p POST for actions
  %p
    Optional: hidden inputs with
    %code name=_method
    to send DELETE and PUT requests

%section
  %h2 Databases
  %p We don't have a variable for every bit of data in our system.
  %p
    FB has 500 million users - they don't have a variable
    = succeed "." do
      %code user5000000000
  %p We store data in a database program. We send data to the database, and we can retrieve it later.

%section
  %h2 Persistant
  %p Data stored in databases is persistant - kept permanantly
  %p Data in our programs is transient - kept in RAM which is cleared after our program quits
 
%section
  %h2 Types of database
  %p Relational - PostgreSQL, MySQL
  %p Key/value - CouchDB, MongoDB
  %p Data-structures - Redis
  %p Graph - Neo4J

%section
  %h2 PostgreSQL
  %p We're using a Relational Database called PostgreSQL
  %p Open source, fast, reliable

  %img{src:"img/postgres.png"}

%section
  %h2 Relational database intuition
  %p Very much like spreadsheets
  %p Columns are the facts about each entity - row
  %p e.g columns: name, age, rows: bob, sarah

%section
  %h2 Relational database example

%section
  %h2 Database summary
  %p We're using a Relational Database called PostgreSQL
  %p We query it via SQL
  %p We use databases to store data permanently, so we can retrieve it in our programs.
  %p
    We
    %code create
    new data in the database,
    %code retrieve
    it, and we can also
    %code update
    or 
    %code delete
    it. CRUD makes a basic web app!

%section
  %h2 Next steps
  %p Expand the app
  %p Look at an ORM - object relational mapper - like ActiveRecord
  %p Look at Rails
